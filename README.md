# Zebra

**Zebra** is an acronym for *ZFS Enhanced Backup &amp; Restore
Application* &ndash; that being said, it shouldn't be too hard to guess
what purpose *Zebra* is designed for. Yes, you're right: *Zebra* is a backup
application. Being more precise, *Zebra* is a command line application,
configurable by simple plain text files. Therefore, it easily runs on headless
computers (i. e. servers).

*Zebra* offers a specific set of features, which may either make it **the**
tool for your purpose &ndash; or render it useless for you. That's what *Zebra*
offers:

* Full, differential and incremental backups of ZFS datasets
* ZFS dataset recovery from backup
* Adaptable backup rotation policies
* Optional encryption of backup files
* Remote storage of backups via OpenSSH
